# LightsOut

formulates the algorithm, known as ‘Quantum Lights Out Solver', which exploits the Quantum phenomenon for solving a Lights out problem on a Quantum Device. It successfully translates the problem in the Quantum domain and provides an efficient solution to the problem. It utilizes a counterintuitive concept called Grover’s algorithm, which uses quantum superposition and amplitude amplification trick for effectively solving the problem. This search algorithm reduces the time complexity of searching the O(N) solution space to O(√N).
